Project Description: Academic Exchange – Buy, Sell, or Rent Study Materials* 
 
*Academic Exchange* is a web-based platform designed to help students and learners easily *buy, sell, or rent academic books and study materials*. Many students finish a semester or complete their studies and are left with books, notes, and learning resources that they no longer need. At the same time, new learners are searching for affordable study materials. Our platform connects these two groups, creating a seamless and cost-effective solution. 
 
The application acts as a *marketplace for pre-owned educational resources*, allowing users to list items they wish to sell or rent, while buyers can browse, compare, and purchase items based on their needs and budget. This reduces waste, promotes sustainable learning, and gives students access to essential resources at lower prices.
